✅ COMPLETED: Robust VS Code-style save functionality with best practices

## 🎉 Features Implemented (Following Best Practices Architecture):

### Core Save Functionality:
- ✅ **Monaco Editor Integration** - Get text content directly from editor instances
- ✅ **Unified IPC Communication** - Single save handler for both save and save-as operations
- ✅ **Async File Operations** - Node.js fs.promises for non-blocking file operations
- ✅ **Save (Ctrl+S)** - Save current file without dialog
- ✅ **Save As (Ctrl+Shift+S)** - Show dialog and save to new location

### Robust Architecture Implementation:
- ✅ **Separated Save Logic from Tab Management** - Save operations isolated from UI state
- ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle** - Save handler only handles saving
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling** - Comprehensive error catching and user feedback
- ✅ **State Isolation** - File save state separate from UI tab state
- ✅ **Notification System** - Clean user feedback for all operations

### VS Code-like User Experience:
- ✅ **Modified File Indicator** - Orange ● dot for unsaved changes
- ✅ **Save Status Notifications** - "Saving...", "File saved successfully", etc.
- ✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Ctrl+S and Ctrl+Shift+S work globally
- ✅ **Unsaved Changes Warning** - Confirmation dialog when closing modified files
- ✅ **Save Buttons** - UI buttons in editor header with tooltips
- ✅ **File Type Detection** - Language badges and syntax highlighting

### Technical Implementation:
- ✅ **Editor Instance Management** - Store Monaco editors for content access
- ✅ **File State Tracking** - Track original vs current content for modification detection
- ✅ **Path Consistency** - Proper relative/absolute path handling
- ✅ **TypeScript Support** - Fully typed interfaces and unified save options
- ✅ **Security Best Practices** - File operations stay in main process

## 🐛 BUG FIXED: Tab Auto-Closing After Save (FINAL SOLUTION)

### Root Cause:
**Problematic useEffect Hook** that was triggered by save operations

### Final Solution Applied:
- **❌ Removed** the problematic `useEffect` completely
- **✅ Moved** active file management directly into `handleTabClose`
- **✅ Implemented** robust save handlers with proper separation of concerns
- **✅ Result** - Save operations completely isolated from tab management

### New Robust Save Architecture:
```javascript
// Unified save handler with flexible options
const result = await window.electronAPI.saveFile({
  content,
  filePath: filePath,
  showDialog: false // Controls whether to show save dialog
});

// ONLY updates file state - no tab management side effects
setOpenFiles(prev => 
  prev.map(file => 
    file.path === filePath 
      ? { ...file, originalContent: content, isModified: false }
      : file
  )
);
```

### Why This Architecture is Superior:
- **No useEffect** = No unintended triggers during save operations
- **Unified save handler** = One robust method handles both save and save-as
- **Async operations** = Non-blocking file operations with proper error handling
- **Clean separation** = Save logic completely separate from UI management
- **Maintainable** = Clear single responsibility principle

## Architecture (Best Practices):
1. **Monaco Editor** - Text editing and syntax highlighting
2. **Renderer Process** - UI logic with isolated save operations
3. **Unified IPC Layer** - Single robust save handler
4. **Main Process** - Async file operations with proper error handling

The IDE now implements industry-standard save functionality with complete separation of concerns! 🚀
